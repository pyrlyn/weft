# Research

The question: what open format should describe user interfaces so that AI agents can read, write, validate and edit them — something between JSON and HTML. This file holds the prior art, the comparison, the chosen direction, and what the prototype has measured so far.

Every external fact carries its primary source and the date it was checked. Statements about what suits language models are design hypotheses; the benchmark (`bench/`, task T8) is what confirms or refutes them. Measurements quoted here come from this repository and name the file they come from.

## 1. Existing formats

| Custom Elements Manifest | Contract of a web component | Schema 2.1.0, released 2024-05-06; covers tag name, attributes, properties, events, CSS variables and parts | https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest (2026-10-03) |
| A2UI | Agent-generated UI as JSON | Flat component list with id references, client-side catalog of trusted components, streaming messages; v0.9.1 current, v1.0 release candidate | https://a2ui.org/specification/v0.9-a2ui/ , https://a2ui.org/specification/v1.0-a2ui/ (2026-10-03) |
| json-render | Agent-generated UI as JSON or YAML | Apache-2.0; catalog of components and actions defined with Zod (`defineCatalog`); flat spec `{ root, elements }` with child id lists; YAML wire format with a streaming parser; renderers for React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, React Native and others | https://github.com/vercel-labs/json-render (2026-10-03) |
| MCP Apps | Delivery of UI from MCP servers | SEP-1865: `ui://` resources carrying sandboxed HTML (`text/html;profile=mcp-app`); accepted 2026-01-26 | https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/1865-mcp-apps-interactive-user-interfaces-for-mcp (2026-10-03) |

Two observations follow from the table. JSX, Lit, Svelte and MDX are code: a document in them is a program, so it cannot be validated against a closed vocabulary or rendered from an untrusted source without executing it. A2UI and json-render are data constrained by a catalog, which is exactly the trust boundary an agent-facing format needs, but both encode the tree as a flat map of ids.

## 2. What makes a format convenient for language models

These are the properties Weft was designed for. Each is a hypothesis; the column on the right says how the prototype tests it.

| Property | Why it should help a model | How it is tested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed vocabulary, one meaning per element | No guessing what a `div` with classes means | Strict validation rejects unknown kinds (`W401`, `W2xx`) |
| One way to say a thing | Fewer variants to learn and to compare | Canonical form: `serialize(parse(x))` is byte-stable; tested on 10 000 generated documents |
| Explicit hierarchy | Nesting is visible locally instead of reconstructed from id references | Token cost and edit success against A2UI (T8) |
| Enumerated states | `state="loading"` instead of flag combinations | Catalog declares states; `W203` on undeclared ones |
| Named slots | The model sees where content may go, the validator can check it | `W207`, `W208` |
| Stable ids on every element | Edits and actions can address an element | Patches by id (SPEC §7) |
| No code | Bindings and named actions only; safe to render from an untrusted source | Injection tests in the renderer and JSX generator |
| Diagnostics written for repair | Path, expectation and the nearest valid value make one repair cycle enough | Repair-cycle validity target in T8 |
| Low token cost | Cheaper context, more room for the task | `bench/REPORT.md` |

## 3. Validation approaches

| Approach | For | Against | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JSON Schema (current version 2020-12) | Standard; accepted by provider structured-output modes | Context rules ("`tab` only inside `tabs`") are awkward; error messages are generic | https://json-schema.org/specification (2026-10-03) |
| Custom schema language | Exact nesting rules | Its own tooling; nobody knows it | — |
| Type system (Zod, TypeScript) | One source for types, runtime checks and JSON Schema export | Tied to the TypeScript ecosystem | json-render uses it: https://github.com/vercel-labs/json-render (2026-10-03) |

Chosen: Zod as the source of truth (`packages/core/src/model.ts`), JSON Schema as an export (`catalogJsonSchema`, `documentJsonSchema`), and a separate semantic layer for what neither expresses well — unique ids, parent and child rules, loop scope, tokens, actions, numeric ranges. Diagnostics are an API with stable codes (SPEC §6.2).

## 4. How agents interact with UI today

| Channel | For agents | Against | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Screenshots | Works on anything; sees the real rendering | High token cost (image tokens); coordinates are approximate and break on layout changes | https://playwright.dev/mcp/snapshots (2026-10-03) |
| DOM and selectors | Exact and complete | Large and noisy; selectors break | — |
| Accessibility tree (Playwright MCP snapshot) | "A structured tree of accessible elements with refs for interaction"; text only, low cost, deterministic | Depends on the quality of the page's markup; read-only | https://playwright.dev/mcp/snapshots (2026-10-03) |
| Figma API | `GET /v1/files/:key` and `GET /v1/files/:key/nodes` return the node tree with layout and auto-layout properties, component metadata and annotations | Describes design intent, not a running UI; layers are not semantics | https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/file-endpoints/ (2026-10-03) |

Agents read UI through the accessibility tree and write it as JSX or HTML: two vocabularies for one object. Weft declares ARIA roles in the document, so what an agent writes can be compared with what a user of assistive technology — or a browsing agent — reads back. The prototype does this comparison in Chromium (`packages/render-react`).

## 5. Compared approaches

| Approach | For agents | Against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Raw HTML or JSX | Most familiar syntax; full expressiveness | Cannot be validated or rendered safely; ambiguous semantics |
| B. Catalog JSON (A2UI, json-render) | Strict validation, streaming, id-addressed patches, trust boundary | Verbose; hierarchy is reconstructed from references |
| C. Accessibility snapshot | Compact; carries actions | Read-only: no layout, tokens or slots; no way back to code |
| D. Component manifest (Custom Elements Manifest, CSF) | Exact component contract | Describes components, not screens |
| E. Strict markup with a canonical JSON form (Weft) | Reads like HTML, validates like JSON, patches by id | New syntax that has to prove its benefit |

## 6. Directions considered

1. **A profile on top of A2UI** — A2UI as is, plus ARIA semantics and DTCG token references. Low risk; verbosity and the flat graph remain.
2. **Strict markup with canonical JSON** — one semantic model, two serializations: markup for models, JSON for tools.
3. **A writable accessibility snapshot** — extend the snapshot format so it can be written as well as read. Reading and writing coincide, but it is web-only and tied to one tool's format.

## 7. Decision

Direction 2, named Weft. It takes the catalog and trust boundary from A2UI and json-render, the component contract shape from Custom Elements Manifest, roles and states from WAI-ARIA and the APG patterns, design values from DTCG, and nested markup as the model-facing surface. Because roles live in the document, an agent reads and writes one vocabulary.

The main risk was that markup is not measurably better than catalog JSON for models. The stop criterion: if Weft gives neither 25% fewer tokens nor 10 points more successful edits than A2UI JSON, the creator decides whether to continue.

## 8. What the prototype has shown

Implemented (details in `done.md`): specification 0.1 (`SPEC.md`), parser, serializer, validator and CLI (`packages/core`), the core catalog of 29 components and a DTCG token loader (`packages/catalog`), a React renderer checked in Chromium (`packages/render-react`), importers from accessibility snapshots and DOM (`packages/from-aria`), a JSX generator (`packages/to-jsx`), patches and an MCP server with six tools (`packages/mcp`), a forward-compatibility suite (`compat/`), and a corpus of 12 screens in four formats with a benchmark harness (`corpus/`, `bench/`).

Measured (`bench/REPORT.md`, proxy tokenizer o200k_base, 12 screens):

| Format | Tokens | Weft as a share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Weft | 2502 | — |
| HTML | 2524 | 99% |
| JSX | 2965 | 84% |
| A2UI v0.9 | 7702 | 32% |

- Weft needs 67.5% fewer tokens than A2UI JSON, so the token half of the stop criterion is met. Against HTML there is no size advantage; any advantage there has to come from validation and edit accuracy.
- The tokenizer is a proxy, not Claude's. Exact counts need an API key.
- A2UI's basic catalog v0.9 has no table, switch, menu, link, alert or form submit; the corpus approximates them, so the comparison is partly approximate (`corpus/README.md`).
- Writing the corpus exposed gaps in the first draft of the spec (bound text on buttons, submit buttons, empty states, numeric ranges); they were closed in T9.
- Round trips hold: document → render → accessibility snapshot or DOM → document keeps structure, roles and states on all 12 screens, and ids through DOM. Generated JSX renders the same HTML as the reference renderer on 12 screens and 29 catalog examples.

Not yet measured: how well real models generate and edit Weft compared with the baselines — first-try validity, validity after one repair cycle, and edit success. That is T8 in `plan.md`.

## 9. Open questions

| Question | State | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format versioning | Answered for 0.x: minor versions only add; lenient readers warn and keep unknown content; catalog changes are classified major, minor or none | SPEC §8, `compat/`, `diffCatalogs` |
| Extensibility without breaking agents | Answered: `x-<vendor>-` extensions with an ARIA fallback role; unknown elements render as `group` | SPEC §8 |
| Mapping to code and back | Partly: React renderer and JSX generator; SwiftUI generator and importer (T34); importers from DOM and snapshots with a documented loss table | SPEC §9, `roadmap.md` |
| Streaming and incremental generation | Open. Flat id lists in A2UI and json-render exist for progressive rendering; nested markup has to show it can do the same | `roadmap.md` |
| Host capabilities | Answered for MCP hosts: `weft_capabilities` reports the format version, catalogs, token paths and action names the host checks (T10); other hosts are not covered | SPEC §8, `packages/mcp` |
| Layout without becoming CSS | Decided (T16.1), built in T16.2–T16.8: `justify` on `stack`, a universal `grow`, `padding` and `max-width` on `stack` and `grid`, `min-column-width` on `grid`, `size.*` tokens; no breakpoints | `docs/layout-design.md`, §21 |
| Who keeps a registry of extension catalogs | Built (T17.1–T17.3; decided in T17.0): no service; `{ "package": … }` catalog entries found in `node_modules` (SPEC §10.2), `docs/publishing-catalogs.md`, `docs/catalogs.md`; a curated list in the docs kept by the creator, an npm keyword, author-declared kind prefixes | `docs/extension-catalogs-design.md`, §22 |
| Figma as a source | Open | `roadmap.md` |

| Not JSON Type Definition | JTD (RFC 8927) is closed by default and simpler, but fewer tools and models know it | https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8927 (2026-10-05) |
| An object schema with `properties` and no `additionalProperties` is closed | A deliberate deviation from JSON Schema, where objects are open: a misspelled binding path must be an error, not an allowed extra member (SPEC §10.5) | — |

WebAssembly does run in a bare `JSContext` on macOS 27 (a hand-written module returned 5), which does not change that | `crates/weft-wasm/Cargo.toml`; `JSContext` run locally (2026-10-05) |
| A helper tool in a sandboxed extension needs exactly two entitlements | "a child target must use exactly two App Sandbox entitlement keys: `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` and `com.apple.security.inherit`"; any other and "the system aborts the child process"; the parent is spawned with `posix_spawn` or `NSTask` and never has inherit set.

## 13. Token modes and typography (T45)

Checked on 2026-10-05. The resolver module is the published report, not the editor's draft on the repository's `main` branch (that draft says "preview draft … do not implement").

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Resolver Module exists in 2025.10 | "Design Tokens Resolver Module 2025.10", a Final Community Group Report dated 28 October 2025, published with the Format 2025.10 Weft already reads | https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/resolver/ (2026-10-05) |
| Root of a resolver document | `version` (required, must be `2025.10`), `resolutionOrder` (required), `sets`, `modifiers`, `name`, `description`, `$schema`; the JSON Schema has `"version": { "const": "2025.10" }` and `"required": ["version", "resolutionOrder"]` | Resolver 2025.10 §Syntax; https://www.designtokens.org/schemas/2025.10/resolver.json (2026-10-05) |
| Sets | A set has a `sources` array of reference objects and inline token trees, merged in array order: the last occurrence of a token wins | Resolver 2025.10 §Sets |
| Modifiers and contexts | A modifier has a `contexts` map of name to an array of sources (merged like a set's) and an optional `default` that must be one of the contexts ("Tools MUST throw an error if the value is not present"); 0 contexts is an error, 1 context "SHOULD" be one; a context may reference a set but never a modifier | Resolver 2025.10 §Modifiers, §Contexts, §Default |
| Resolution order | `resolutionOrder` lists sets and modifiers, by reference (`#/sets/…`, `#/modifiers/…`) or inline with `name` and `type` (`set` or `modifier`, names unique); later entries override earlier ones; a modifier contributes only the context the input selects | Resolver 2025.10 §Resolution order, §Inline sets and modifiers |
| Aliases resolve after flattening | "Aliases MUST NOT be resolved until this step"; the flattened tree "behaves the same as if it were one source", so the existing loader runs on it unchanged | Resolver 2025.10 §Resolution logic |
| Inputs | An input is an object of modifier name to context name; a modifier without `default` needs one; inputs "SHOULD be case-insensitive". Weft has no input of its own, so it takes each modifier's `default`, else its first context (a Weft rule, SPEC §10.3) | Resolver 2025.10 §Inputs, §Input validation |
| Reference objects | `{ "$ref": … }` with a JSON Pointer; same-document pointers are required, files relative to the resolver and remote URLs optional; no circular references; nothing may point into `resolutionOrder`, and only `resolutionOrder` may point at a modifier; keys beside `$ref` override shallowly. Weft supports same-document and project-file references, not URLs | Resolver 2025.10 §Reference objects, §Invalid pointers, §Extending |
| File extension | "Users SHOULD use the `.resolver.json` file extension" | Resolver 2025.10 §File extension |
| Typography `letterSpacing` and `lineHeight` | `letterSpacing` is a dimension; `lineHeight` is a number, "a multiplier of the fontSize" | https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/format/ §Typography (2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI letter spacing is `tracking(_:)` | View `tracking(_:)`, iOS 16 / macOS 13: "additional space, in points, that the view should add to each character cluster after layout", like CSS `letter-spacing`; `kerning(_:)` changes character offsets instead, and tracking wins when both are set | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/tracking(_:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/tracking(_:) (2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI line height on iOS 17 is `lineSpacing(_:)` | `lineSpacing(_:)` sets "the amount of space between the bottom of one line and the top of the next"; View `lineHeight(_:)` is iOS 26 / macOS 26 only, above the iOS 17 / macOS 14 target. So the spacing is the CSS line box (size × multiplier) minus the font's own line height, with half of it as vertical padding, the half-leading CSS puts above the first and below the last line | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/linespacing(_:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/lineheight(_:) (2026-10-05) |
| A dynamic colour on iOS 17 / macOS 14 | SwiftUI has no light-and-dark `Color` initializer at this target; `UIColor(dynamicProvider:)` and `NSColor(name:dynamicProvider:)` give one that follows the appearance, wrapped by `Color(uiColor:)` / `Color(nsColor:)` | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/init(dynamicprovider:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor/init(name:dynamicprovider:) (2026-10-05) |

## 14. Running only the checks a change affects (T54)

Checked on 2026-10-05 against the pinned tools: moon 2.5.6 (`moon run --help`, run in the repository), cargo-nextest 0.9.143, Vitest 5.0.3. "Measured" rows are experiments in the T54 worktree, reproducible with the commands given; the other rows cite the vendor's documentation.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| moon's affected mode selects a task when a changed file matches its declared `inputs`, and can add graph relations with `--upstream` and `--downstream` (`none`, `direct`, `deep`) | "Any modified file matching the task's `inputs`" makes a task affected; relations are controlled by `--upstream` and `--downstream`; `moon run` pre-fills `--upstream=deep` and no downstream | https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/affected, https://moonrepo.dev/docs/commands/run (2026-10-05); options listed by `moon run --help` of moon 2.5.6 |
| moon's affected mode cannot narrow this workspace | Measured: with one appended line in `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`, `moon query affected` lists all 21 projects and every `test` task, because the inherited `test` task declares `/packages/**/*` as an input (`.moon/tasks/all.yml`); with one line in `crates/weft-swiftui/src/lib.rs` and `--downstream deep` it lists every task that depends on `root:wasm`, though the module does not contain that crate | `moon query affected` and `moon query affected --downstream deep` of moon 2.5.6 in the worktree |
| Narrowing the declared inputs to fix that would break the cache | The packages' tests read sibling packages by path as well as by import (for example `packages/core/test/cases.ts` reads `packages/from-aria`, `bench/test/agent-spec.test.ts` reads `packages/catalog`), and a task hash covers only its own inputs, so dropping the coarse glob would serve stale results in the full check | `grep` of the test sources in the worktree; hash contents in `.moon/cache/hashes/*.json` |
| nextest selects tests by reverse dependency | `rdeps(name-matcher)` "includes tests in matching crates and all the crates that (possibly transitively) depend on" them; `=name` is the equality matcher, and a bare name is a glob; union is `\|`; `-E` takes the filterset | https://nexte.st/docs/filtersets/reference/ (2026-10-05) |
| `-E 'rdeps(=weft-swiftui)'` runs the crate and its dependents | Measured through `moon run root:rust-test -- -E "'rdeps(=weft-swiftui)'"`: 74 tests: 20 in `weft-swiftui`, 40 in `weft-cli` and 14 in `weft-snapshots`, the two crates that depend on it | cargo-nextest 0.9.143 in the worktree |
| moon passes the arguments after `--` to a shell unquoted | Measured: `moon run root:rust-test -- -E 'rdeps(=x)'` failed with a bash syntax error at `(`; the filterset therefore carries its own quotes | moon 2.5.6 in the worktree |
| Arguments after `--` are part of the task hash | Measured: `.moon/cache/hashes/*.json` of `mcp:test -- --changed HEAD` lists `--changed` and `HEAD` among the arguments, and its hash differs from the plain run's, so a narrowed run is never served as the full run | moon 2.5.6 in the worktree |
| Vitest runs the tests related to changed files | `--changed [since]` takes a commit or branch, compares against it (uncommitted changes when empty) and runs the tests affected; the module graph finds them across workspace packages (measured: a changed `packages/render-react/src/index.ts` ran the `@weft/mcp` files that import it); a data file read by a test without an import is not followed | https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html, https://vitest.dev/config/changed (2026-10-05); measured in the worktree |
| The determinator maps changed files to cargo packages but is a library | The crate "figures out what packages in a Rust workspace changed between two commits", picks "the package nearest to the file", treats a file outside every package as a full rebuild, has no command-line program; latest 0.12.0 | https://docs.rs/determinator/latest/determinator/ (2026-10-05), https://github.com/guppy-rs/guppy |
| Rejected: wrapping the determinator in a Rust program | It would add a crate and a build for a mapping of about ten lines (`cargo metadata --no-deps` gives each package's directory and workspace dependencies); its extra value, comparing dependency versions between two lockfiles, is replaced by running the full check when a lockfile or root manifest changes | decision, T54 |

## 15. Richer controls (T50)

Checked on 2026-10-05. Apple pages were read as their documentation JSON (`developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/documentation/...`); the Playwright row is a measurement with `playwright-core` 1.63.0 on the pinned Chromium, not a document.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slider` is the ARIA `slider` role, drawn on the web by `<input type="range">` | The slider pattern requires `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` (and `aria-valuetext` when the number is not friendly) and the arrow, Home, End and Page keys; HTML-AAM maps `input type=range` to `slider`, so the native element carries all of it | https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/, https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/ (2026-10-05) |
| Range defaults and clamping | `min` 0, `max` 100, `step` 1; a value outside the range is clamped to the nearest bound; with `max` below `min` the control cannot be used and takes `min`. Weft writes the sanitized value itself so every target shows the same number | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range (2026-10-05) |
| A range input rounds an off-step value | `<input type="range" min="0" max="10" step="2" value="3">` reports value `4` and the snapshot line `slider "Vol": "4"` | Measured with Playwright 1.63.0 `ariaSnapshot()` on the pinned Chromium (2026-10-05) |
| `stepper` is the ARIA `spinbutton` role, drawn by `<input type="number">` with two pointer-only buttons | The spinbutton pattern requires `aria-valuenow` (and min/max when there are bounds), arrow keys step, Home and End jump to the bounds, and "the text field is usually the only focusable component", so the buttons are visual aids: `tabindex="-1"` and `aria-hidden="true"`; HTML-AAM maps `input type=number` to `spinbutton` | https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/, https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/ (2026-10-05) |
| `date-picker`: one kind for a date, a time or both | HTML has three input types with fixed value formats: `date` is `yyyy-mm-dd`, `datetime-local` is a date and time without a time zone, `time` is a time; each takes `min`, `max` and `step`. SwiftUI's `DatePicker` shows any of them through `displayedComponents` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/date, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker (2026-10-05) |
| A date or colour input has no ARIA role | HTML-AAM gives `input type=date`, `datetime-local` and `color` "No corresponding role"; Playwright's accessibility snapshot reports all of `date`, `time`, `datetime-local` and `color` as `textbox` (`textbox "Due": 2026-10-05`, `textbox "Accent": "#3b82f6"`). Because SPEC §9 requires the rendered tree to carry the declared role, the catalog declares `textbox` for both | https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/ (2026-10-05); measured with Playwright 1.63.0 (2026-10-05) |
| `color-picker` value is `#rrggbb` | `input type=color` takes a CSS colour and falls back to `#000000` when the value is invalid; the browser's own sanitization wants seven-character lowercase hex, and `alpha` is opt-in, so Weft writes lowercase `#rrggbb` and no alpha. SwiftUI's `ColorPicker(selection:supportsOpacity:)` is told `supportsOpacity: false` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/color, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/colorpicker (2026-10-05) |
| `segmented-control` is a radio group | APG has no segmented-control pattern: it says radio buttons "in a toolbar are frequently styled in a manner that appears more like toggle buttons" and keeps the radio group roles and keys (arrows move and check). So a segmented control is `radiogroup` of `radio`, as `radio-group`, and only the look differs | https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/ (2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI segmented picker | `Picker` with `.pickerStyle(.segmented)`: "A picker style that presents the options in a segmented control", iOS 13 / macOS 10.15 | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/pickerstyle/segmented (2026-10-05) |
| `combobox` is an editable combobox, drawn by `<input list>` and `<datalist>` | The combobox pattern separates select-only from editable comboboxes, which "allow typing, either accepting arbitrary values or filtering suggestions"; the native pair is a text input with a `datalist` of suggestions, "not a replacement for `<select>`", where the content entered "always comes from the `value` attribute". Playwright reports it as `combobox "Fruit": app` | https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist (2026-10-05); measured with Playwright 1.63.0 |
| `datalist` is linked by `id` | The input's `list` attribute must equal the datalist's `id`; every Weft element has an `id`, so the renderers always derive one for the datalist | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist (2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI has no editable combobox | No view in SwiftUI combines a text field and a suggestion list outside `searchable`; the generator uses a `TextField` with a trailing `Menu` of the options | Not found: no SwiftUI view is documented as a combobox; the `searchable` modifier's suggestions belong to a search field (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/controls-and-indicators, checked 2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI controls | `Slider(value:in:step:)` (iOS 13, `value` a `Binding<V>`, `in` a `ClosedRange<V>`, so a lower bound above the upper one is a runtime error the generator must prevent); `Stepper(_:value:in:step:)` (iOS 13); `DatePicker(_:selection:in:displayedComponents:)` (iOS 13); `ColorPicker(_:selection:supportsOpacity:)` (iOS 14) | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/slider, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/colorpicker (2026-10-05) |
| Figma and Penpot draw no native controls | Both tools build a control from frames, rectangles and text, as the library already does for `switch` and `checkbox`; the drawings use the same primitives (`createFrame`, `createRectangle`, `createText`; Penpot `createBoard`, `createRectangle`, `createText`) and keep the Weft source in plugin data | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0, `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0 `index.d.ts` (2026-10-05) |

## 16. Moon cache correctness (T56, T57)

Checked on 2026-10-05 against the pinned tools: moon 2.5.6, Vitest 5.0.3, cargo 1.99.0. "Measured" rows are experiments in the T56 worktree, reproducible with the commands given; the other rows cite the vendor's documentation.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A glob input can be negated with `!`, and `@group(name)` expands a file group | "Globs can be negated by prefixing with `!`"; file groups are referenced in inputs as `@group(name)` | https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project (2026-10-05) |
| Moon's docs say gitignored files are not inputs, but `node_modules` and the gitignored build outputs were hashed | Measured: `.moon/cache/hashes/<hash>.json` of `mcp:test` lists `packages/*/node_modules/.bin/*`, `packages/mcp/node_modules/.vite/vitest/*/results.json`, `packages/core/native/*` and `packages/visual/diffs/*`, all in the root `.gitignore`; the docs' own advice is to exclude explicitly | moon 2.5.6 in the worktree; https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project (2026-10-05) |
| Vitest writes its results cache under Vite's `cacheDir`, `node_modules/.vite` by default | "Vitest stores cache for test results to run the longer and failed tests first"; `cacheDir` moves it | https://vitest.dev/config/cache (2026-10-05) |
| The cause of the uncached `mcp:test`: the results file is an input of the next run | Measured: `moon run mcp:test` twice gave hashes 4898c4f7 and bf68f179; the second manifest differs from the first by exactly `packages/mcp/node_modules/.vite/vitest/da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709/results.json` | moon 2.5.6, Vitest 5.0.3 |
| The inherited `/packages/**/*` made it every package's problem, and two more folders had the same effect | Measured: after the `node_modules` exclusion, `moon run :test` twice still re-ran all 22 test tasks; the manifests differed by `packages/core/native/*` (built by `core:test`'s dependency `root:native` while other suites were already hashed) and `packages/visual/diffs/*`; a third pair of runs re-ran only `shared:test`, whose own `/plugins/*/**/*` hashed the plugins' `node_modules` | moon 2.5.6 |
| Excluding `node_modules` loses no dependency change | Measured: the manifest of `mcp:test` carries a `toolchain: javascript` entry with the project's resolved production dependencies (integrity hashes from the lockfile); `/pnpm-lock.yaml` is added for the dependencies of sibling packages | moon 2.5.6 |
| The addon's files stay out of the suites' inputs, and its hash reaches them through `deps` | Under `WEFT_ENGINE=auto` every suite that imports `@weft/core` loads `packages/core/native/` when it is built, so the addon is something each suite reads. A task dependency's hash flows into the dependent's hash with the `hash` strategy, the default for a dependency that declares outputs (`root:native` does); `root:native` is therefore a dependency of the inherited `test` task, which also builds it before any suite starts. Measured: `moon query tasks` lists `root:native` among the `deps` of every test task except `tooling:test`, which replaces its deps (it never loads the core); a one-line change in `crates/weft-node` re-ran every suite (the T57 Result in `done.md`) | https://moonrepo.dev/docs/config/project, task dependency `cacheStrategy` (2026-10-05); https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/cache; moon 2.5.6 in the worktree |
| Rejected: moving Vitest's cache with `cacheDir` | It fixes Vitest's cache only; `native/` and `diffs/` are not Vitest's, and one exclusion list in the inherited task covers all of them | https://vitest.dev/config/cache (2026-10-05) |
| The WebAssembly module's crate closure | `cargo tree -p weft-wasm -e normal,build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, with and without `--features web`: `weft-wasm`, `weft-binding`, `weft-catalog`, `weft-core`, plus `weft-import` and `weft-web` with `web`; `weft-node` adds nothing to the native addon's six; `weft-swiftui`, `weft-cli` and `weft-snapshots` are in neither | cargo 1.99.0 in the worktree; https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html |
| The closure is computed from `cargo metadata`, not written twice | `resolve.nodes[].deps[].dep_kinds[].kind` is `null` for a normal dependency, `"build"` or `"dev"`; the test walks the workspace members that are not development-only from the root crate; `--all-features` joins the builds with and without `web` (an over-approximation is the safe side) | https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-metadata.html (2026-10-05) |
| Files a crate reads from outside its folder are inputs too | `include_str!` resolves "relative to the current file"; the closure's sources include `packages/catalog/catalog.json` and `packages/catalog/tokens/default.tokens.json` (weft-catalog). The second was missing from the old input list: a change to the default tokens served a stale module. The test now fails for a missing include | https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html (2026-10-05); `crates/weft-catalog/src/core.rs` |
| Narrowed per crate folder, not per `src/` | The crate folders also hold `tests/` and docs the build does not read, but `build.rs`, `Cargo.toml` and any file named by a macro could sit anywhere in the folder, and proving otherwise for each crate is what the test would have to do again; the broader input is kept and costs a rebuild only for a crate the build contains | decision |
| The build reads no other file | No `.cargo/config.toml` or `rust-toolchain*` in the repository (the toolchain comes from `mise.toml`, a moon implicit input through `.moon/`), `weft-node/build.rs` only calls `napi_build::setup()`, and the other crates have no build script (`ls crates/*/build.rs`) | repository files, 2026-10-05 |
| Measured: the WebAssembly task after a change in a crate outside the closure | `moon run root:wasm` with a line appended to `weft-swiftui/src/lib.rs` and to `weft-cli/src/main.rs`: cached (7 ms, same hash 8c5b857e); the same on a line in `weft-core/src/lib.rs`: rebuilt (15.9 s, new hash); reverted: cached. `root:native` likewise: cached after a `weft-swiftui` change, rebuilt after a `weft-web` change | moon 2.5.6 in the worktree |

## 17. Streaming and incremental generation (T11)

Checked on 2026-10-06. "Measured" rows are experiments in the T11 worktree (Apple Silicon, other agents running, so the numbers are an upper bound); the other rows cite the vendors' documentation.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A2UI streams by flat component lists | v0.9 has four messages (`createSurface`, `updateComponents`, `updateDataModel`, `deleteSurface`); components carry ids and arrive in any order; the client keeps a component map and rebuilds the tree; rendering can begin once `root` is defined | https://a2ui.org/specification/v0.9-a2ui/ (2026-10-06) |
| json-render streams as JSON patches | `@json-render/core` has `createSpecStreamCompiler()`; `compiler.push(chunk)` returns the accumulated spec and the new patches, and the page renders the partial spec; `@json-render/yaml` adds a streaming YAML parser | https://github.com/vercel-labs/json-render (2026-10-06) |
| Nested markup streams as a prefix, so no id list is needed | Markup is written front to back, so the text received so far is a prefix; the tokenizer already closed every open element at the end of the input, and partial mode keeps that tree and reports the closing as `pending` (SPEC §6.3) | `crates/weft-core/src/syntax.rs`, `crates/weft-core/src/parse.rs` |
| The cost is paid by the model and the reader, not by the format | A flat id list lets elements arrive in any order and be replaced one by one; a prefix grows only at the end and an element cannot be changed once written. Patches (SPEC §7) cover the changes after the first pass | decision |
| Measured: re-parsing the whole text on every chunk is cheap | All 19 corpus screens (982 characters on average, 2136 at most), strict mode with the core catalog: one full `parse` takes 0.20 ms on the native addon and 0.25 ms on WebAssembly. Re-parsing a growing prefix after every 16 characters (about 60 chunks per screen, 134 for the largest) takes 10.3 ms per screen on the native addon and 12.4 ms on WebAssembly, 33 ms and 39 ms for the largest, so 0.1 to 0.3 ms per chunk | script in the T11 session, `partial: true`, 5 repetitions after a warm-up |
| So no incremental parser is built | The work per chunk is quadratic in the text length, but a model writing at tens of tokens per second gives a chunk every 20 to 100 ms against 0.3 ms of parsing; an incremental tokenizer would add state to both engines for no visible gain. Revisit for documents hundreds of times larger than the corpus | decision |
| Every cut of every screen is covered by a test | `crates/weft-catalog/tests/partial.rs` cuts the 19 corpus screens and the catalog examples after every character and checks: no error in `diagnostics`, only the listed codes in `pending`, a document from the root start tag on, never fewer elements than the shorter prefix, and the full text equals `parse`. `packages/render-react/test/stream.test.ts` repeats it through the engines at every UTF-16 unit and renders every 11th prefix | the tests |

## 18. Glass material tokens (T51)

Checked on 2026-10-05. Apple pages were read as their documentation JSON (`developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/documentation/...`); the Figma and Penpot rows are the type declarations of the pinned packages, not the web pages.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DTCG has no material type, and `$type` must be one of its own | The format lists its types (colour, dimension, font family, font weight, duration, cubic bezier, number, and the composites border, transition, shadow, gradient, typography); a token's `$type` is one of them, so a Weft-only `$type` of `material` would make the file invalid for every standard tool | https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/ (2025.10) |
| A standard tool must keep what it does not understand | "The optional `$extensions` property is an object where tools MAY add proprietary ... data to a design token ... each tool MUST use a vendor-specific key"; the reverse domain notation is recommended; "Tools that process design token files MUST preserve any extension data they do not themselves understand" | https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/ §5.2.3 (2025.10) |
| The token is written as a `color` token with a `dev.weft.material` extension | The tint is an ordinary DTCG colour, so any tool reads the file and shows the tint; the blur, which no DTCG type holds, is a DTCG dimension in the extension and survives a round trip through other tools. The alternative, a composite of a colour and a dimension under a Weft `$type`, is not valid DTCG | The two rows above |
| The tint's opacity is the colour's own `alpha` | The Color Module's colour value has an `alpha` of 0 to 1 (default 1) and a `hex` fallback; one opacity, not a second field | https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/color/ (2025.10) |
| Modes need nothing new | A material is a token, so a resolver modifier (T45) gives it a different value per context like any other | SPEC §10.3 and `done.md` T45 |
| CSS `backdrop-filter` | A standards-track property of Filter Effects Module Level 2; Chrome 76, Firefox 103, Safari 18 (9 with the `-webkit-` prefix). It is not interoperable in every supported browser, hence the solid fallback in an `@supports not` rule | https://drafts.csswg.org/filter-effects-2/#BackdropFilterProperty; https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/css/properties/backdrop-filter.json; https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/features/backdrop-filter.yml (all 2026-10-05) |
| SwiftUI `glassEffect(_:in:)` | "Applies the Liquid Glass effect to a view", iOS 26.0 and later; the `Glass` configuration has no blur radius. A Weft blur radius therefore has no value in it, and the tint is the one part a token sets (`Glass.tint(_:)`) | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/glasseffect(_:in:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/glass (iOS 26.0) |
| SwiftUI `Material` before iOS 26 | "A background material type", iOS 15.0 and later (macOS 12.0); a fixed set of thicknesses (`ultraThin` ... `ultraThick`), no radius. The generator picks the thickness nearest the token's blur | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/material (iOS 15.0) |
| Figma draws it as a `BACKGROUND_BLUR` effect | `BlurEffectBase`: `type` is `LAYER_BLUR` or `BACKGROUND_BLUR`, `radius` must be >= 0, plus `visible`; the tint is the node's fill | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0 (`plugin-api.d.ts`) |
| Penpot draws it as `backgroundBlur` | `Shape.backgroundBlur?: Blur`, with `Blur.value?: number` and `hidden?: boolean` | `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0 (`index.d.ts`) |
| Token files are untrusted, so the numbers are bounded | The tint's `alpha` must be in 0 to 1 and the blur between 0 and 100 px; a token outside that is reported (T007) and left out, never clamped silently. Figma only requires >= 0 and CSS accepts any length, so the upper bound is Weft's own | `crates/weft-catalog/src/tokens.rs` |

| How a web element is tilted in 3D | The `transform` list takes `perspective(<length>)`, `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, `rotateZ()`; `perspective()` computes into the element's own matrix, so no parent needs a `perspective` property, and the list is applied right to left (the last function acts on the points first) | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-2/ (2026-10-06) |
| Which viewer draws a glTF on the web | `@google/model-viewer`, Apache-2.0, version 4.3.1 (latest), last published 2026-06-04 | https://registry.npmjs.org/@google%2fmodel-viewer (2026-10-06) |
| What a page shows while the viewer is not there | A child with `slot="poster"` "will replace the default poster" and "is shown until the model is loaded and revealed"; an element that is not defined (no script) renders its children, so the child image is what a screenshot of a page without the script shows | https://github.com/google/model-viewer/blob/v4.3.1/packages/modelviewer.dev/data/docs.json (slot `poster`, 2026-10-06); HTML Standard, unknown elements are `HTMLUnknownElement` / undefined custom elements, inline with their children |
| Whether `Model3D` runs on iOS | No: in the iOS 27.0 simulator SDK, `_RealityKit_SwiftUI.swiftinterface` declares `Model3D` as `@available(visionOS 1.0, *)` with `iOS`, `macOS`, `tvOS`, `watchOS` unavailable; `RealityView` is `iOS 18.0`, `macOS 15.0` | `Xcode.app/.../iPhoneSimulator27.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/_RealityKit_SwiftUI.framework/.../arm64-apple-ios-simulator.swiftinterface` (Xcode on this machine, 2026-10-06) |
| Model formats per platform | model-viewer loads glTF 2.0 (`.glb`, `.gltf`); RealityKit loads USDZ (and `.reality`); neither reads the other's format, so the element carries both paths | https://modelviewer.dev/docs/ and Apple's RealityKit documentation (the SDK interface above shows no glTF loader) |
| Design tools cannot draw a 3D tilt | The plugin APIs give a layer a 2D `rotation` (degrees) and a 2D affine `relativeTransform`; neither has a perspective or an axis | https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-rotation/ (2026-10-06); Penpot's shape `rotation` in `packages/penpot/src/api.ts` |

## 20. Constrained generation (T12)

Checked on 2026-10-08; the provider rows (T12.3) on 2026-10-12.

| Decision or fact | Basis | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The document schema is generated from the catalog, in Rust, as a projection of the validator | One source of truth: the catalog decides what the validator accepts, so the schema is derived from the same `Catalog` and the validator's own table of universal attributes (SPEC §3.1), and the validator keeps the last word. The Zod `documentJsonSchema()` knows no catalog and stays as it is until T12.2 | decision; `crates/weft-catalog/src/document_schema.rs` |
| Dialect 2020-12, reuse through `$defs` and `$ref` | "The `$defs` keyword reserves a location for schema authors to inline re-usable JSON Schemas" (Core §8.2.4); `$ref` is an applicator to a statically identified schema (§8.2.3.1), so one entry per kind and recursive lists cost one entry each | https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core (2026-10-08) |
| `integer: true` maps to `"type": "integer"` | "integer" "matches any number with a zero fractional part" (Validation §6.1.1), which is the validator's own test (`fract() == 0`, `W224`), so `2.0` passes both | https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation (2026-10-08) |
| Grammars as `pattern`, but not the look-around ones | Patterns "SHOULD be valid according to the regular expression dialect described in" ECMA-262 and built with the `u` flag (Core §6.4). The id, binding, token and action grammars need only classes, groups and repetition; "no reference inside a literal" (`W213`) needs look-ahead and "characters XML can carry" (`W221`) needs ranges beyond the BMP, so both stay in the validator | https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core (2026-10-08); SPEC §3.1 |
| The catalog only, no `x-` extensions | Creator's decision for T12.1: project token, action and data-path enums are left for later (revisited after T12.3 measures), and a constrained writer has no use for extensions, which strict mode would still allow | decision (T12 open questions 1 and 2) |
| Anthropic structured outputs: request shape | The schema goes in `output_config.format` with `type: "json_schema"`; the reply is the JSON in the text block. Strict tool use (`strict: true`) shares the same limits | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs (2026-10-12; the page shows no date) |
| Anthropic: what the schema may use | Supported: `anyOf`, `allOf` (not with `$ref`), local `$ref`/`$defs`, `const`, `enum` of scalars, `additionalProperties: false` (required on every object), `minItems` 0 or 1, simple `pattern`s (no look-around, no backreferences). Not supported: "Recursive schemas", numerical constraints (`minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`), string length constraints, other array constraints; an unsupported feature is a 400 | same page (2026-10-12) |
| Anthropic: size limits | Across all strict schemas of one request: at most 24 optional parameters (each property not in `required`) and 16 parameters with union types (`anyOf` or type arrays); beyond that an internal limit on the compiled grammar ("Schema is too complex for compilation", 400) and a 180-second compilation timeout | same page (2026-10-12) |
| The core document schema against those limits | Generated by T12.1 for `weft-core` 0.2.0: 60,806 bytes compact, 72 `$defs` of which 36 reach themselves through `$ref` (a node's `children`), 132 `anyOf`, 416 optional properties, 6 `minimum`/`maximum` bounds. It breaks four Anthropic limits at once, so Anthropic cannot take it whole; per the creator's answer to T12.3 question 2, Anthropic is reported as unsupported for `weft-json-constrained`, with no reduced profile | `crates/weft-snapshots/tests/snapshots/document-schema/weft-core.snap`; `bench/src/schema-limits.ts` |
| Anthropic price for the T12.3 estimate | Per MTok, input / output: Opus 5.5 $4 / $20, Sonnet 5.5 $2 / $10, Haiku 4.5 $1 / $5; the Batch API halves each (Opus 5.5 $2 / $10, Sonnet 5.5 $1 / $5, Haiku 4.5 $0.50 / $2.50) | https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing (2026-10-12) |
| LM Studio structured output | OpenAI-compatible `response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: { name, strict, schema } }`; the reply is a JSON string in `choices[0].message.content`. GGUF models are held to the schema by llama.cpp's grammar-based sampling, MLX models by Outlines. The page lists no supported or unsupported schema features and warns that models below 7B parameters may not manage structured output | https://lmstudio.ai/docs/developer/openai-compat/structured-output (2026-10-12; no date or version shown) |
| llama.cpp JSON Schema to grammar | Converts "a subset" of JSON Schema: local `$ref` (but "Nested `$ref`s are broken"), `anyOf`/`oneOf` (not mixed with `properties` in the same type), `pattern` only anchored `^…$`, `minimum`/`maximum` only on `integer`; `additionalProperties` defaults to `false`; unsupported features are skipped silently, so a grammar can be looser than the schema. Whether LM Studio takes the whole core schema is measured by the trial, not assumed; the validator scores every reply either way | https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/8bb3cf0d216a5ae48360179f2931daf284be4d01/grammars/README.md (2026-10-12) |

## 21. Layout (T16)

Checked on 2026-10-08. The question is how much layout Weft can say so that every target draws it alike and reads it back. Apple pages were read as their documentation JSON (`developer.apple.com/tutorials/data/documentation/swiftui/...`); the Figma and Penpot rows are the type declarations of the pinned packages, which are the vendors' own API definitions; the Slint rows are the source of the pinned crates; the A2UI rows are the copy of its catalog the snapshot tests already use. The proposal built on these facts is `docs/layout-design.md`.

**Main-axis distribution** (how the free space along a row or column is shared):

| System | Values | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS Flexbox | `justify-content`: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, initial `flex-start`; further values come from CSS Box Alignment. `gap` is a minimum between items, so free space is shared on top of it | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/ (Candidate Recommendation Draft of 2025-10-14; checked 2026-10-08) |
| A2UI v0.9 | `Row` and `Column` take `justify`: `start`, `center`, `end`, `spaceBetween`, `spaceAround`, `spaceEvenly`, `stretch`, default `start`; "Use 'spaceBetween' to push items to the edges" | `specification/v0_9/catalogs/basic/catalog.json` of `a2ui-project/a2ui` at commit `4787774e92` (copy in `crates/weft-snapshots/tests/a2ui-schemas/basic_catalog.json`; checked 2026-10-08) |
| Figma auto layout | `primaryAxisAlignItems`: `MIN`, `MAX`, `CENTER`, `SPACE_BETWEEN`, `SPACE_EVENLY`, `SPACE_AROUND` | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0, `plugin-api.d.ts` |
| Penpot flex layout | `justifyContent`: `start`, `center`, `end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, `stretch` | `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0, `index.d.ts`; https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/designing/flexible-layouts/ (checked 2026-10-08) |
| Slint | `HorizontalLayout`/`VerticalLayout` `alignment` of type `LayoutAlignment`: `stretch`, `center`, `start`, `end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`; "Matches the CSS flex box". The property declares no default, and `stretch` is the enum's first value | `i-slint-compiler` 1.18.1 `builtin_elements.rs`, `i-slint-common` 1.18.1 `enums.rs` |
| Jetpack Compose | `Arrangement.Start`, `End`, `Center`, `SpaceBetween`, `SpaceAround`, `SpaceEvenly`, `spacedBy(space)`; `SpaceAround` puts half the inner space before the first and after the last child | `compose/foundation/foundation-layout/.../Arrangement.kt` of `androidx/androidx`, branch `androidx-main` (checked 2026-10-08) |
| SwiftUI | No distribution parameter on `HStack`/`VStack`. `Spacer` is "a flexible space that expands along the major axis of its containing stack layout"; a spacer also makes the stack take "as much space as the parent view allows". So `start`, `center`, `end`, `space-between` and `space-evenly` are spacers placed around or between the children; `space-around` (half spaces at the ends) has no spacer form | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/spacer (iOS 13.0; checked 2026-10-08) |

**Child sizing** (which child takes the free space):

| System | Form | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS Flexbox | `flex: <number>` is "equivalent to `flex: <number> 1 0`"; `flex: none` is `0 0 auto`; the initial `flex` is `0 1 auto`, so an item hugs its content and may shrink. Flex items have an automatic minimum size (their content), so a growing item needs `min-width: 0` to shrink below its content | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/ §4.5, §7.1 (2025-10-14; checked 2026-10-08) |
| A2UI v0.9 | `weight`: "The relative weight of this component within a Row or Column. This is similar to the CSS 'flex-grow' property", only on a direct child of a `Row` or `Column` | `basic_catalog.json` at `4787774e92`, `$defs/CatalogComponentCommon` |
| Figma | `layoutSizingHorizontal`/`layoutSizingVertical`: `FIXED`, `HUG`, `FILL`; `HUG` only on auto-layout frames and text, `FILL` only on auto-layout children; a shorthand for `layoutGrow`, `layoutAlign` and the sizing modes. `layoutGrow` is 0 or 1: Figma has no ratios | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0; https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-layoutsizinghorizontal/ (checked 2026-10-08) |
| Penpot | A child's `horizontalSizing`/`verticalSizing`: `fix`, `fill`, `auto`; no ratios | `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0 (`LayoutChildProperties`) |
| Slint | `horizontal-stretch`/`vertical-stretch`, a float, default 0; "the elements won't be stretched unless all elements are 0"; built-in widgets use 0 or 1 | https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/reference/layouts/overview/ (the page labels itself the documentation of the next version; checked 2026-10-08) |
| Jetpack Compose | `Modifier.weight(weight, fill = true)` in `RowScope`/`ColumnScope`: the parent divides "the horizontal space remaining after measuring unweighted child elements" by weight | `Row.kt` of `androidx/androidx`, branch `androidx-main` (checked 2026-10-08) |
| SwiftUI | `frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` makes a view flexible, so the stack gives it the free space; `layoutPriority(_:)` decides which child shrinks last and stretches first ("Views typically have a default priority of 0"). Neither gives ratios | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/frame(minwidth:idealwidth:maxwidth:minheight:idealheight:maxheight:alignment:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/layoutpriority(_:) (iOS 13.0; checked 2026-10-08) |

**Padding and maximum size:**

| System | Form | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS | `max-width` and `max-height` "specify the maximum width" and height of a box, initial value `none`; `min-width` has the initial value `auto` | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/ (Working Draft of 2026-09-04; checked 2026-10-08) |
| Figma | `paddingLeft`/`Right`/`Top`/`Bottom` and `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/`minHeight`/`maxHeight` on auto-layout frames and their direct children; all of them, `itemSpacing` and the grid gaps can be bound to variables (`VariableBindableNodeField`) | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0 |
| Penpot | Container `leftPadding` … `bottomPadding` (and `horizontalPadding`/`verticalPadding`); child `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/`minHeight`/`maxHeight`, `null` for none | `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0 |
| Slint | Layouts take `padding` and `padding-left` … `padding-bottom`; every element takes `min-width`, `max-width`, `preferred-width` (and heights) | `i-slint-compiler` 1.18.1 `builtin_elements.rs`; https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/reference/layouts/overview/ (checked 2026-10-08) |
| SwiftUI | `padding(_:_:)` adds "an equal padding amount to specific edges"; `frame(maxWidth:)` caps a size, and a frame with only a maximum adopts the child's size within it | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/padding(_:_:) (iOS 13.0; checked 2026-10-08) |
| A2UI v0.9 | No padding, width or size property on any component of the basic catalog | `basic_catalog.json` and `common_types.json` at `4787774e92` (searched for `padding`, `width`, `margin`; checked 2026-10-08) |

**Reflow** (a layout that changes with the space it gets):

| System | Form | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS Grid | `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(25ch, 1fr))` makes "as many 25-character columns as will fit"; `auto-fit` does the same and collapses empty tracks; `minmax()` is allowed inside the repetition, with a fixed minimum | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/ §7.2.3 (Candidate Recommendation Draft of 2025-03-26; checked 2026-10-08) |
| CSS container queries | `@container (width > 40em) { … }` applies rules by the size of a container (`container-type: inline-size`); the at-rule is standard-track and shipped in Chrome 105, Firefox 110 and Safari 16 | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-3/ (Working Draft of 2022-08-18), https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/css/at-rules/container.json (checked 2026-10-08) |
| SwiftUI | `GridItem.Size.adaptive(minimum:maximum:)` places "as many items of the minimum size as possible" in the space of one flexible item (iOS 14); `Grid` (iOS 16) has fixed rows; `ViewThatFits` (iOS 16) shows "the first child view that fits"; the `Layout` protocol (iOS 16) lets an app define its own container | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/griditem/size-swift.enum/adaptive(minimum:maximum:), https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/grid, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/layout (checked 2026-10-08) |
| Figma | `layoutMode: 'GRID'` with `gridColumnCount` and tracks of type `FLEX`, `FIXED` or `HUG`; no automatic repetition | `@figma/plugin-typings` 1.140.0 (`GridLayoutMixin`, `GridTrackSize`) |
| Penpot | Grid tracks of type `flex`, `fixed`, `percent` or `auto`; the user guide names no breakpoint or automatic repetition | `@penpot/plugin-types` 1.5.0; https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/designing/flexible-layouts/ (its grid part; checked 2026-10-08) |
| Slint | `GridLayout` places children by `row` and `col`, with no automatic repetition. 1.18.1 also has a `FlexboxLayout` with `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` | `i-slint-compiler` 1.18.1 `builtin_elements.rs` |
| A2UI v0.9 | No grid: "To create a grid layout, nest Columns within this Row" | `basic_catalog.json` at `4787774e92` |

**Conclusions for Weft** (decisions proposed in `docs/layout-design.md`, not approved):

| Finding | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| `start`, `center`, `end` and `space-between` exist in every target, `space-between` through spacers in SwiftUI | They are the proposed `justify` values. `space-around` has no SwiftUI form; `space-evenly` has one (spacers at both ends too) but no corpus screen needs it |
| Figma, Penpot and SwiftUI have no ratios for growing children | Child growth is a yes/no `grow`, not a weight |
| Every target but A2UI has padding and a maximum size, and Figma and Penpot can bind both to variables | `padding` and `max-width` take dimension tokens and survive the design-tool round trip |
| Only CSS and SwiftUI reflow a grid by a minimum column width; no design tool and no Slint layout does | Grid reflow is one token (`min-column-width`); targets without it draw `columns` and keep the prop |
| Container queries and breakpoints are viewport or container rules with no form in SwiftUI, Slint, Figma or Penpot | No breakpoints |

## 22. Extension catalogs (T17)

Prior art for loading several catalogs at once: how component vocabularies are namespaced, shipped and found. Checked on 2026-10-08 unless a row says otherwise. The design built on it, approved by the creator, is `docs/extension-catalogs-design.md` (T17.0).

### Namespacing

| Fact | Finding | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom element names carry a hyphen, and nothing assigns prefixes | A valid custom element name contains `-`, starts with an ASCII lower alpha, has no ASCII upper alpha and is not one of eight reserved SVG/MathML names. The definition says nothing about who owns a prefix; there is no prefix registry in the standard | https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name (Living Standard, last updated 2026-10-07) |
| Collisions on the web are now solved by scoping, not by names | The HTML Standard defines scoped registries: `new CustomElementRegistry()` makes a scoped registry, and "a node with an associated scoped CustomElementRegistry will use that registry for all its operations". So a page can use two libraries' `ui-button` in different shadow roots, while one flat document still cannot | Same page (2026-10-07) |
| A Custom Elements Manifest names no package and no prefix | The `Package` interface has `schemaVersion`, `readme`, `modules` and `deprecated` and no `name`; the only name is each element's `tagName`. So an importer can see a prefix only by reading the tags | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest/main/schema.d.ts (schema 2.1.0) |
| A colon in an XML name means a namespace | XML 1.0: the Namespaces recommendation "assigns a meaning to names containing colon characters", so "authors should not use the colon in XML names except for namespace purposes", though processors must accept it | https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/ §2.3 (Fifth Edition, 2008-11-26) |
| An undeclared prefix breaks namespace-aware readers | A prefix must be declared with `xmlns:prefix` on the element or an ancestor ("Prefix Declared"); a document that breaks a namespace constraint can be well-formed XML 1.0 but is not namespace-well-formed, and processors must report it | https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/ §4, §8 (Third Edition, 2009-12-08) |
| ESLint: the plugin author proposes a namespace, the user may pick another | A plugin's `meta.namespace` "should match the prefix you'd like users to use"; in a config the namespace is the key of the `plugins` object, and "you don't need to use the same name that the plugin prescribes. You can specify any prefix that you'd like"; rules are written `example/rule` | https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins and https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/plugins (v10.12.0 docs) |
| shadcn: namespaces are chosen by the consumer | Registries are declared in `components.json` under `registries` as `@name` → URL template with `{name}`; items are addressed `@acme/button`; "Since there's no central authority, you don't need to worry about namespace collisions"; when two items write the same file, the later one wins | https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace |
| Slint: library imports are renamed at the import | `import { Button as CoolButton } from "../other_theme/button.slint"` is the documented answer when two files export the same name; library paths (`@mylibrary/switch.slint`) are mapped to local directories at compile time (`with_library_paths`, `-Lmylibrary=…`), never fetched | https://releases.slint.dev/1.7.1/docs/slint/src/language/syntax/modules (1.7.1); https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/guide/language/coding/file/ (next) |
| Swift: the module is the unit of distribution | "A module is a single unit of code distribution … that can be imported by another module with Swift's `import` keyword" | https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-book/blob/main/TSPL.docc/LanguageGuide/AccessControl.md (main) |
| Swift: a module name qualifies a type (`Foundation.Date`) | Common practice for resolving two modules' equal type names | **unverified** (not found in the pages read) |
| A2UI: one catalog per surface, identified by a URI | A catalog is a JSON Schema of components, functions and themes; `catalogId` is by convention a URI and should equal the file's `$id`; the client sends `supportedCatalogIds` in preference order and the agent picks one per surface for its lifetime; a final catalog is standalone (no external references), built by a linking step; a custom catalog extends the basic one with `allOf` and `$ref`. Component names are plain (`SuggestionChips`), with no namespacing guidance | https://a2ui.org/concepts/catalogs/ (v0.9 page) |

### Distribution and discovery

| Fact | Finding | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A package points at its manifest with a custom `package.json` field | "customElements": "custom-elements.json", a path relative to the package root | https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest (README, schema 2.1.0) |
| npm documents no rule for custom fields | The `package.json` page documents named fields only; it does not say arbitrary fields are allowed (the CEM field above shows the practice) | https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json (npm 11.21.0) |
| What a published package always contains | `files` lists what is included; `package.json`, the README, the LICENSE, the `main` file and the `bin` files are always included | Same page |
| `exports` hides every other file from module resolution, not from the disk | "When the `exports` field is defined, all subpaths of the package are encapsulated", `require('pkg/subpath.js')` throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, while a direct absolute path still loads. `package.json` itself is hidden unless exported | https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html (Node v26.11.1) |
| Node finds packages by walking up | From the requiring file's directory, Node tries `./node_modules`, then each parent's `node_modules`, up to the root of the file system | https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html, "Loading from node_modules folders" (Node v26.11.1) |
| npm scopes are owned | Signing up or creating an organization grants "a scope that matches your user or organization name", used as a namespace for related packages | https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes (page edited 2023-10-23) |
| Packages can be found by keyword | The registry search `GET /-/v1/search?text=keywords:<word>` filters by `package.json` keywords | https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md |
| ESLint uses a name prefix and keywords for discovery | Plugin packages are named `eslint-plugin-<name>` or `@<scope>/eslint-plugin-<name>` and list the keywords `eslint`, `eslintplugin`, `eslint-plugin` | https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins (v10.12.0 docs) |
| Integrity is a hash string | Subresource Integrity metadata is `sha256-`, `sha384-` or `sha512-` followed by a base64 digest; npm's lockfile `integrity` is "a sha512 or sha1 Standard Subresource Integrity string" | https://www.w3.org/TR/sri-2/ (Working Draft, 2026-03-20); https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-lock-json (npm 11) |
| A bare version is a compatibility range | Cargo: "`log = "^1.2.3"` is exactly equivalent to `log = "1.2.3"`"; compatibility is decided by the left-most non-zero component, so `0.2.3` means `>=0.2.3, <0.3.0` | https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html |
| A schema's identity is a URI, and URIs are not fetched | `$id` "MUST resolve to an absolute-URI"; implementations "SHOULD NOT assume they should perform a network operation when they encounter a network-addressable URI" and "SHOULD understand ahead of time which schemas they will be using" | https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core §8.2.1, §8.2.3, §9.1.2 (2020-12) |

### Registries

| Fact | Finding | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| shadcn keeps a curated directory in its repository | A registry is added by a pull request that edits `apps/v4/registry/directory.json` in `shadcn-ui/ui`, after `pnpm validate:registries`; "it will be validated and reviewed by the team"; listed registries are "built into the CLI with no additional configuration required"; a registry must be open source and public | https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-index; https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/directory |
| shadcn items name their dependencies across registries | `registryDependencies` takes bare names (shadcn/ui items), `@namespace/item`, `owner/repo/item` or a URL of an item file | https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-item-json |

## 23. WinUI 3 (T105)

Checked on 2026-10-14. The question is how a Weft screen becomes a WinUI 3 page bound to a generated C# view model, how the XAML reads back, and what a Windows CI job needs to build it. API pages were read in their `windows-app-sdk-2.0` view (the default, updated 2026-07-28); the conceptual pages carry their own `ms.date`. The design built on these facts is `docs/winui-design.md`.

### Binding

| Fact | Finding | Source (checked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x:Bind is compiled and typed | Bindings are generated as code at compile time; the root is the page (or the template's `x:DataType` inside a `DataTemplate`, which is required there); errors in a path are build errors | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/platform/xaml/x-bind-markup-extension (ms.date 2026-07-15; checked 2026-10-14) |
| x:Bind's default mode is `OneTime` | So every binding of changing data states `Mode=OneWay` or `Mode=TwoWay` | same page |
| x:Bind converts `bool` to `Visibility` | `true` → `Visible`, `false` → `Collapsed`, without a converter; property bindings only, not function bindings | same page |
| x:Bind binds events to methods | The method must not be overloaded and must match the event's signature, have no parameters, or take parameters assignable from the event's | same page |
| x:Bind supports indexers | `Teams[0].Players` when the property's type implements `IList<T>` (not `IReadOnlyList<T>`); `Players['John Smith']` for `IDictionary<string, T>` | same page |
| x:Bind `UpdateSourceTrigger` | Settable on x:Bind; the default is `PropertyChanged` for every property except `TextBox.Text`, whose default is `LostFocus` | same page |
| x:Bind attached-property paths | A path step names an attached property in parentheses, `{x:Bind Button22.(Grid.Row)}` | same page |
| Function bindings | A path may call a method, also a static one through a namespace prefix (`{x:Bind local:Helpers.Not(ViewModel.X)}`); arguments are paths or literals; a two-way function binding needs `BindBack`, a method that takes the new value | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/data-binding/function-bindings (ms.date 2026-09-05; checked 2026-10-14) |
| A C# keyword as an x:Bind path segment | Does not compile: the XAML compiler writes the segment into the page's `.g.cs` as it is, so `ViewModel.class` and `ViewModel.event.on` against `@class` and `@event` fail with CS1055 and CS0106 (`Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` 2.5.1, .NET SDK 10.0.402) | https://github.com/pyrlyn/weft/actions/runs/38656182916 (checked 2026-10-15) |
| Why `@` cannot help in an x:Bind path | The XAML compiler's binding-path grammar has its `'@' Identifier_or_keyword` alternative commented out (`src/XamlCompiler/BuildTasks/BindingPath/CSharpIdentifier.g4`), `BindingPath.g4` accepts no `@`, and `PropertyStepCodeGenerator` writes a property step into the `.g.cs` unescaped; so a keyword-named property needs another member name (T105.17: a `_` suffix) | https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml, `main` @ 866ba81a, `src/XamlCompiler/BuildTasks/BindingPath/CSharpIdentifier.g4`, `BindingPath.g4`, `src/XamlCompiler/BuildTasks/CodeGenerators/BindPathStepCodeGenerators.cs` (checked 2026-10-17) |
| C# reserved keywords | 77 words reserved everywhere, usable as identifiers only with `@`; contextual keywords (`value`, `var`, `field`, …) are identifiers outside their context | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/ (updated 2026-10-15; checked 2026-10-17) |
| One-time x:Bind to a custom attached property, and static function bindings with `object?` parameters | Compile: `weft:On.Press="{x:Bind ViewModel.order_payCommand}"`, `weft:Weft.Truthy(...)`, `weft:Weft.Hide(...)` in the T105.1–T105.2 goldens build with no warning | https://github.com/pyrlyn/weft/actions/runs/38657119567 (checked 2026-10-15) |
| Two-way x:Bind to a custom attached property | **unverified**; no golden binds one yet, and the `winui` job checks it once one does | — |
| `ItemsRepeater` | No built-in UI, selection or scrolling; `ItemsSource` takes any `IEnumerable` (`INotifyCollectionChanged` for updates); a `DataTemplate` child is its `ItemTemplate`; layouts are `StackLayout` (`Orientation`, `Spacing`) and `UniformGridLayout`; no default accessibility | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/ui/controls/items-repeater (ms.date 2026-09-19; checked 2026-10-14) |
| `UniformGridLayout` sizing | Every item is the same size; without `MinItemWidth`/`MinItemHeight` the first item's measured size is the minimum; `MaximumRowsOrColumns`, `ItemsStretch` (`None`, `Fill`, `Uniform`) and `ItemsJustification` share the rest | same page; https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.uniformgridlayout |
| A custom `ItemsRepeater` layout | `NonVirtualizingLayout` (a `Layout`, so a `DependencyObject`) is the base class to inherit for a layout without virtualization; it overrides `MeasureOverride(NonVirtualizingLayoutContext, Size)` and `ArrangeOverride(NonVirtualizingLayoutContext, Size)`, the context's `Children` are the repeater's elements, and `Layout.InvalidateMeasure()` re-measures every container using the layout | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.nonvirtualizinglayout and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.nonvirtualizinglayoutcontext (updated 2026-07-28; checked 2026-10-17) |
| Page resources | `Page.Resources` holds a page's own keyed resources; a `<ResourceDictionary>` declared in it can carry `ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries` keyed `Light`, `Dark`, …; a `{StaticResource}` or `{ThemeResource}` looks up the element's ancestors' `Resources` to the page root before `Application.Resources`, and a key may repeat at different levels, the nearest winning | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/platform/xaml/xaml-resource-dictionary (ms.date 2026-10-13; checked 2026-10-17) |
| `ItemsControl` items or a source | Remarks: to display data, bind `ItemsSource` and do not populate `Items`; for a fixed list, populate `Items` and do not set `ItemsSource`. So a `ComboBox` cannot mix static items with a bound list | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol (view `windows-app-sdk-2.0`, updated 2026-07-28; checked 2026-10-17) |
| `MenuFlyout` has no `ItemsSource` | Its content property is `Items` (`IList<MenuFlyoutItemBase>`) and it has no `ItemsSource`; the page's own example adds `MenuFlyoutItem`s to `Items` in code at run time | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.menuflyout (view `windows-app-sdk-2.0`, updated 2026-07-28; checked 2026-10-17) |
| `DataTemplate.LoadContent` | Creates the template's elements and returns its root, which code may add to another element | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.datatemplate.loadcontent (updated 2026-09-30; checked 2026-10-17) |
| Template x:Bind follows the root's `DataContext` | The compiler connects a template's bindings to its root with `SetDataRoot(element.DataContext)` and `element.DataContextChanged += bindings.DataContextChangedHandler`, which calls `SetDataRoot(args.NewValue)` and `Update()`; so a loaded template rebinds when its root's `DataContext` is set | https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/866ba81a1c7c644e41fb838c755273e8f73e3a74/src/XamlCompiler/TestMasters/RegressionProjects/fre/Features/CompiledBinding/BindTestbedCS/generated/Templates.g.cs (compiler test master, checked 2026-10-17) |
| A `DataTemplate` in a custom attached property, x:Bind to a custom attached property on a `MenuFlyout` | **unverified**; the T105.16 goldens use both, and the `winui` job checks them | — |

| Theme dictionaries and the type ramp | `ResourceDictionary.ThemeDictionaries` keyed `Light`, `Dark`, `HighContrast`; `{ThemeResource}` re-evaluates when the theme changes, `{StaticResource}` does not; type ramp styles `CaptionTextBlockStyle`, `BodyTextBlockStyle`, `BodyStrongTextBlockStyle`, `SubtitleTextBlockStyle`, `TitleTextBlockStyle`, `TitleLargeTextBlockStyle`, `DisplayTextBlockStyle` | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/platform/xaml/xaml-theme-resources (ms.date 2026-07-27; checked 2026-10-14) |
| `AccentButtonStyle`, the status text brushes | **unverified**; T105.3 checks them in the Windows build | — |
| Perspective on a parent | A `PerspectiveTransform3D` is meant for the root or a parent element and its effect is inherited by the children; `OffsetX` and `OffsetY` are relative to the element's centre, so a `Border` with the perspective projects the element it holds | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.media.media3d.perspectivetransform3d (updated 2026-07-28; checked 2026-10-17) |
| `CompositeTransform3D` centre and sign | `CenterX`, `CenterY`, `CenterZ` are in pixels (the page's example centres a 300 px wide element with `CenterX="150"`), so a centre that follows the size needs code; the rotations are counter-clockwise, and the example's `RotationY="-30"` turns the right edge away from the viewer | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.media.media3d.compositetransform3d (updated 2026-07-28; checked 2026-10-17) |
| CSS rotations | `rotateY(a)` is `rotate3d(0, 1, 0, a)`, whose matrix takes the point (1, 0, 0) to (cos a, 0, -sin a): a positive angle turns the right edge away, so a WinUI rotation is the negated CSS angle | https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-2/#Rotate3dDefined (Editor's Draft; checked 2026-10-17) |
| The order of `RotationX`, `RotationY` and `RotationZ` inside one `CompositeTransform3D` | **unverified**: the page states scale → rotate → translate but not the order of the three rotations; a tilt about one axis does not depend on it | — |
